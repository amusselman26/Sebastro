Best Practices:

Always pull before making any changes and pull after any changes

Always source your environment to ROS humble when opening a new terminal: source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
After navigation to workspace source: source install/setup.bash
When adding or deleting a file use: colcon build --symlink-install
